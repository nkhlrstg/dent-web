They are often used to correct \u00a0malocclusions , as well as, overbites, cross bites, open bites, deep bites, crooked teeth, and various other flaws of the teeth and jaw. Braces can be either cosmetic (Ceramic or clear braces, Lingual braces,Invasalign) \u00a0or structural (Metal braces).<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1667 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/clear-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"150\" \/><\/p>\n<p><strong>Ceramic Braces :\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Ceramic braces are the same size and shape as metal braces, except that they have tooth-colored or clear brackets that blend in to teeth. Some even use tooth-colored wires to be even less noticeable. Pros: Less noticeable than metal braces; move teeth much faster than clear \u00a0aligners \u00a0(Invisalign).<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-1672 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/Lingual.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"175\" \/>Lingual Braces :<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Lingual braces are one of the &#8220;invisible&#8221; treatment methods that your orthodontist may have to offer. For the most part, they look like conventional dental braces that have been mounted on the backside (lingual, tongue side) of of your teeth. As \u00a0Lingual braces are placed behind the teeth (by the tongue and palate), rather than in front, they offer a great cosmetic alternative for those who want their teeth straightened, without the braces showing.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1678 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign2-300x189.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"189\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign2-300x189.jpg 300w, http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign2-768x484.jpg 768w, http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign2-1024x645.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Invisalign: <\/strong><br \/>\nInvisalign is a series of clear, removable teeth aligners that both orthodontists and dentists use as an alternative to traditional metal dental braces. These plastic \u00a0aligners are completely transparent, therefore far more difficult to detect than traditional wire and bracket braces. In addition, the aligners are marketed as being more comfortable than braces. Due to the removable nature of the device, food can be consumed without the encumbrance of metallic braces.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-1675 alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign-teen-300x79.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"79\" srcset=\"http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign-teen-300x79.png 300w, http:\/\/www.dentistinmeerut.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/05\/invisalign-teen.png 638w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" \/>Invisalign Teen:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Until recently, Invisalign was more frequent in adults,\u00a0but now the new FDA approved Invisalign Teen has been purposely designed to give teenagers confidence and comfort.\u00a0 Invisalign Teen is quickly \u00a0spreading fast in India as alternative treatment to braces.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/retainers.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"147\" \/><strong>Retainers:<\/strong><br \/>\nRetainers are custom-made devices, made usually of wires or clear plastic, that hold teeth in position after surgery or any method of realigning teeth. They are most often used before or after dental braces to hold teeth in position while assisting the adjustment of the surrounding gums to changes in the bone. There are three types of retainers typically prescribed by orthodontists and dentists: Hawley, Essix, and Bonded (Fixed) retainers. The best-known type is the Hawley retainer, which includes a metal wire that surrounds the teeth and keeps them in place.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Inman Aligner:<\/strong><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/inman_aligner2.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"147\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\nThe Inman Aligner is a fantastic, simple and hassle-free way of straightening your front teeth. It is the orthodontic treatment of choice for adult relapse. The Inman Aligner utilizes a lingual coil spring that puts pressure on the teeth that need repositioning and a labial bar that reverses the same pressure.These components work together to &#8220;squeeze&#8221; teeth together by pushing and pulling them into alignment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>TOP ORAL CARE TIPS\u00a0\u00a0Related to \u00a0ORTHODONTICS :<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Flossing \u2013 creating a flossing routine is important during orthodontic treatment.
