A crown is a type of dental restoration available in different types of material \u00a0which completely caps or encircles a tooth or dental implant. Crowns are often needed when a large cavity threatens the ongoing health of a tooth.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/teeth_whitening.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"102\" \/>Natural Tooth Whitening :<\/strong><br \/>\nDental bleaching, also known as tooth whitening, is a common procedure in \u00a0the field of cosmetic dentistry. It lightens \u00a0teeth shade &amp; helps to remove stains &amp; discolouration. Whitening is among the most popular cosmetic dental procedures because it can greatly improve how your teeth look. The effects of bleaching can last for several months, but may vary depending on the lifestyle of the patient. Factors that decrease whitening include smoking and drinking dark colored liquids like coffee, tea, \u00a0red wine &amp; eating\u00a0\u00a0berries.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/teeth_replacement.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"147\" \/>Fixed Teeth Replacement : <\/strong><br \/>\nIn a normal, healthy mouth, chewing function is well balanced since each upper tooth has proper contact and function with corresponding lower teeth. But, this natural proper balance is quickly destroyed when a tooth is lost.

The dental bonding procedure utilizes a composite resin and is used for a variety of structural as well as cosmetic purposes. Dental bonding is a dental procedure in which a dentist applies a tooth-colored resin material (a durable plastic material) and hardens it with a special UV \u00a0light. This ultimately &#8220;bonds&#8221; the material to the tooth and improves the overall appearance of teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/white_filling.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"102\" \/>White Filling\/Composite filling :<\/strong><br \/>\nComposite resin filings or white fillings are the most common used fillings at our office. White Fillings or Cosmetic fillings \u00a0enable you to maintain your beautiful white smile even if you require treatment. A composite filling is a tooth-colored plastic and glass mixture used to restore decayed teeth. Composites are also used for cosmetic improvements of the smile by changing the color of the teeth or reshaping disfigured teeth.<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/dental_bridges.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"147\" \/>Dental Bridges :<\/strong><br \/>\nA bridge stabilizes the bite of a patient who is missing one or more teeth. Dental bridges are meant to replace missing teeth by &#8220;bridging&#8221; the gap between two remaining teeth. This involves creation of a pontic (false tooth) with a dental crown on either side. The crowns are fitted over the remaining teeth to hold the false tooth in place. A bridge is fabricated by reducing the teeth on either side of the missing tooth or teeth by a preparation pattern determined by the location of the teeth and by the material from which the bridge is fabricated.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/dental_jewellery.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"97\" \/><strong>Dental\u00a0Jewellry<\/strong><br \/>\nTeeth jewellry is a brilliant way to add sparkles to your smile and stand out of the crowd.
