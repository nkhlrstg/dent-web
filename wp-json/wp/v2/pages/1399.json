As with any facial fracture, consideration must be given for the need of emergency treatment to secure the airway or to obtain hemostasis if necessary before initiating definitive treatment of the fracture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft\" src=\"http:\/\/smilecraze.in\/images\/maxilla_fracture.jpg\" width=\"136\" height=\"147\" \/>Maxilla Fracture : <\/strong><br \/>\nThe maxilla represents the bridge between the cranial base superiorly and the dental occlusal plane inferiorly. Its intimate association with the oral cavity, nasal cavity, orbits and \u00a0other \u00a0structures \u00a0make the maxilla a functionally and cosmetically important structure.The maxillary tuberosity is especially important for the stability of upper dentures.<\/p>\n<p>Fractures involving the maxilla often cause a lot of swelling, so surgeons might delay treating a maxillary fracture for a couple of days until the swelling has gone down. CT scans may be used to get a clear picture of the fracture.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>[\/vc_column_text][\/vc_column][vc_column width=&#8221;1\/3&#8243;][stm_sidebar sidebar=&#8221;812&#8243;][\/vc_column][\/vc_row]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>[vc_row][vc_column width=&#8221;2\/3&#8243;][vc_column_text]Overview : A dental emergency is a type of medical emergency involving the teeth or gingiva.
